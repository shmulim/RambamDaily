# RambamDaily
Daily Rambam on your Android phone.

With masterful precision, the Rambam distilled all the laws taught in the Talmud and other primary texts and organized them by topic in exactly one thousand chapters.
The Rambam's words has been analyzed by scholars for centuries,  who debated and extrapolated the depth of the law from his choice wording. Yet, this text is equally accessible to the layman for whom the Rambam wrote this work with outstanding straightforwardness and clarity.

Since 1984, in an initiative launched by Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, thousands of Jews have taken to a daily regimen of one chapter of Rambam study, covering the entire work over the course of approximately three years.
